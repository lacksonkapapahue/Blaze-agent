/**
 * v0.30.5 (Luke: "create higher measures stopping blaze from calling unrelated skills and also keep track of often
 * performed tasks so it can give priority to creating skills for them").
 *
 *  - [relevant] / [gate]: use_skill and run_skill only load a skill that shares real words with what the user is asking
 *    (the last few user messages, so "yes, do it" still counts the request before it). The user naming the skill always
 *    passes. A weak match is refused once with the reason; the model may call again with `reason` only when the skill
 *    still shares at least one word with the request. No overlap at all is always refused.
 *  - [strongHit]: the per-turn "best matches" list only shows skills matching ≥ 2 distinct request words, or one
 *    name word (a bare description word like "open" or "app" no longer drags a skill in).
 *  - [Freq]: every real task (≥ 2 work tool calls) is counted by its fingerprint (Learn.signature). A task done
 *    [Freq.PRIORITY] times with no skill covering it is flagged: the end-of-turn learning review runs for it with
 *    skill-writing first, and the prompt carries a one-line nudge listing such tasks.
 * Pure except [Freq]'s small store in Settings (FreqLogicTest / SkillGuardTest cover the logic).
