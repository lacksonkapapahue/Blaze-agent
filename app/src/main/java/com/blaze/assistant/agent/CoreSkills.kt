/**
 * Core skills (v0.24.3). Six bundled skills that shape every turn: how Blaze talks (blaze-voice), how it works
 * (blaze-task-workflow), how it codes (blaze-coding-workflow), where output goes (blaze-views), how it uses specialists (blaze-specialists) and how it keeps
 * reusable workflows (blaze-workflow-builder).
 *
 * They are always on: they can't be switched off or deleted in Skills (they're shown there, marked "core"), the
 * library re-seeds them when missing, and their "## Pinned" bullets go into the static part of the system prompt
 * every turn within [BUDGET_CHARS] (≈ 1,600 tokens). The full SKILL.md is still matched per turn and readable with
 * use_skill. The pinned text is read from the shipped assets, so a broken edit in ~/skills can't remove the rules.
 * [pinned] and [block] are pure (CoreSkillsTest).
