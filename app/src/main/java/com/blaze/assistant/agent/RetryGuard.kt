/**
 * v0.27.x: the agent's self-checks (FakeCall, ClaimGuard, refusal and verify nudges) stay on the user's request.
 *
 * Joey asked "show me your memories". The memory lookup ran, the answer said "I checked…", FakeCall thought nothing
 * had run (lookups didn't count) and re-prompted ("Doing it properly this time"); the next answer mentioned an
 * old diagram, ClaimGuard re-prompted again and handed the model the stale current design ("Doing it for real in
 * Design"), and the model opened a solar-panel diagram from an older turn: 1m40s for the wrong thing.
 *
 * Now:
 *  - every corrective re-prompt carries the user's latest message and says to stay on it ([anchor]);
 *  - a turn gets at most [MAX] corrective re-prompts in total, across every kind;
 *  - a claim about a view the user's request has nothing to do with is never "fixed" by doing work in that view
 *    ([ClaimGuard.relevant]): the stray sentence is dropped instead;
 *  - the step labels read like a person ([label]), not "Doing it properly this time".
 * Pure Kotlin, unit-tested in IntentHonestyTest.
