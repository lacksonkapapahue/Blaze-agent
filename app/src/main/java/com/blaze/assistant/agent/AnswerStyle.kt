/**
 * v0.27.x: Blaze answers like it has hands.
 *
 * Joey asked how to get a lightweight TTS model and got a walkthrough that ended "would you like me to walk you
 * through…?" instead of "Want me to install it for you?". When the user asks how to get, install, set up, enable,
 * open or download something Blaze can do itself, the reply leads with that and ends with ONE concrete offer to do
 * it, with the action as the first follow-up chip ([turnHint]). A clear command is simply done.
 *
 * Joey's constraint: no generic "want me to help?" tails. An offer only when there's a concrete, directly related
 * action Blaze can take next. Facts, explanations, greetings and finished tasks end without a question ([RULE]).
 * Pure Kotlin, unit-tested in IntentHonestyTest.
