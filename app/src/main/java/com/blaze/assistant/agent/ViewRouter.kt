package com.blaze.assistant.agent

/**
 * Views first (v0.23.0). Luke's rule: Blaze always uses its views. Output that fits a view (a deck of
 * flashcards, a page, a reminder, a picture, a memory…) is made THERE, the view is opened or linked,
 * and the chat gets a short answer, never the whole thing dumped as text.
 *
 *  - [PROMPT]: the always-present VIEWS block of the system prompt (each view, what belongs there,
 *    the tool that writes to it, and the hard rule).
 *  - [route]: a cheap keyword/intent classifier (no model call) that picks the view a request needs.
 *    The agent loop turns it into a required-view hint ([hint]) and switches on that view's tools ([Spec.groups]).
 *  - [cardsFrom] / [deckName] / [shouldConvert]: the safety net for Learn. When the model still writes
 *    flashcards or a quiz as text without calling the flashcards tool, the agent turns that text into
 *    a Learn deck (or re-prompts once when nothing can be parsed).
 * Pure Kotlin (no Android), unit-tested in ViewRouterTest.
