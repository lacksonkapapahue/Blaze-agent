/**
 * v0.23.2: no fake claims about views. Luke asked for a 3D rocket and got "I'm on that tall modern 3D
 * rocket… view it in the design section", then "I've updated the design to show the engine" and "I've
 * opened the design view", with no design ever made.
 *
 * A final reply that says it created, updated or opened something in a view ([ViewRouter.specs]) is
 * checked against the tool calls that SUCCEEDED this turn. With no backing call the agent re-prompts once
 * ([nudge]); if it still isn't done, the claim sentences are replaced with an honest line ([honest]).
 * Pure Kotlin, unit-tested in ClaimGuardTest.
