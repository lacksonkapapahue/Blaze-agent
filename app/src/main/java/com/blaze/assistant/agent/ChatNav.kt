/**
 * v0.28.3: where the user is in the shell (Chat | Projects), as one small pure value so the rules are unit tested.
 *
 * Rules (Luke's A12 report: opening a project chat replaced the One Mind main chat):
 *  - The Chat tab always shows the one main conversation ([Mind.MAIN]). Nothing here ever changes that id.
 *  - Project chats open inside Projects: projects list → project page → project chat. Back walks that stack.
 *  - Switching the pill to Chat and back to Projects restores where you were in Projects.
 *  - When something outside the UI shows a project chat (a notification, the secure form card, a reply from a
 *    notification), [follow] moves the user into Projects at that chat instead of loading it into main Chat.
