/**
 * /clear (v0.24.0). Luke: "it clears the screen of all the messages".
 *
 * Only the visible thread is emptied. The conversation's model history stays on disk (chat file `history`),
 * in the journal (`mind.db`, search_chat) and in the long-chat index (`longchat.db`), so One Mind can still
 * look anything up. Blaze also starts a new context window at that point (like Fresh start, but with no
 * "Fresh start" bubble), so it doesn't answer from words the user can no longer see.
 *
 * A short undo (snackbar) puts the messages back while nothing new was sent. Pure Kotlin, unit-tested in ClearScreenTest.
