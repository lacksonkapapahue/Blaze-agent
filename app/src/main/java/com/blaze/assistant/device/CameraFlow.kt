/**
 * v0.28.x camera-fix: the pure decisions behind "+ → Camera" (and the open_camera tool), so every phone ends up
 * with a working way to take a picture instead of a blanket "No camera app found." (CameraFlowTest).
 *
 * The chain: the phone's camera app (ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE with explicit URI grants) → Blaze's own CameraX camera
 * (works with no camera app, in work profiles, on low-end phones) → the photo picker as the last resort.
 *
 * Why the permission step exists at all: zxing-android-embedded (the Desktop pairing QR scanner) declares
 * android.permission.CAMERA in its manifest, so it is in Blaze's merged manifest. Android then refuses
 * ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE with a SecurityException until the user grants CAMERA. That was the Galaxy A07 bug:
 * a fresh install had never granted it (the A12 had, via QR pairing), and the old code turned the
 * SecurityException into "No camera app found."
