# Third-party notices

Copied from Blaze Desktop. On the phone the router is built from blazerouter/ and shipped as libblazerouter.so.

## OmniRoute

BlazeRouter (`internal/router`, its dashboard in `internal/router/web` and the model catalog `internal/router/omniroute_catalog.json`) is a Go port of the routing core of OmniRoute: the auto/* presets and their category:tier ranking, combos and strategies, last-known-good preference, chaos fan-out and the provider catalog.

## three.js

The Design view bundles three.js r170 (`app/src/main/assets/design/three`: `three.module.min.js`, `OrbitControls.js`, `GLTFExporter.js`) so 3D designs open offline, and since v0.23.3 also three.js r162 (`app/src/main/assets/design/three-r162`: `three.module.min.js`, `OrbitControls.js`, `GLTFExporter.js`, `TextureUtils.js`, from the npm package three@0.162.0), the last release that still runs on WebGL 1, for phones whose WebView has WebGL 2 turned off. Both are MIT-licensed by the three.js authors (each folder carries its LICENSE; r162's copyright line reads 2010-2024 three.js authors too).

## Linux desktop (v0.25.1), downloaded on first Start, not bundled
The Desktop view installs these free and open-source packages from Alpine Linux's official repositories into Blaze's
Alpine Linux on the phone, only when the user taps Start (or approves the agent's `desktop` start). None of them is
shipped inside the APK. Each keeps its own licence (as packaged by Alpine; `apk info -L <pkg>` lists its files):

| Package | Project | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| xfce4, xfce4-session, xfwm4, xfdesktop, xfce4-panel, xfce4-terminal, thunar, mousepad | Xfce | GPL-2.0-or-later / LGPL-2.0-or-later |
| tigervnc (Xvnc, vncpasswd) | TigerVNC | GPL-2.0-or-later |
| xdotool | xdotool | BSD-3-Clause |
| imagemagick (import) | ImageMagick | ImageMagick License (Apache-2.0 style) |
| netsurf | NetSurf | GPL-2.0-only |
| dbus, dbus-x11 | freedesktop.org D-Bus | AFL-2.1 OR GPL-2.0-or-later |
| font-dejavu | DejaVu Fonts | Bitstream Vera Fonts License (free) |
| adwaita-icon-theme | GNOME | LGPL-3.0-or-later OR CC-BY-SA-3.0 |

Blaze's VNC viewer (`desktop/Rfb.kt`) is Blaze's own code, written from the public RFB protocol specification (RFC 6143).

## Mermaid (v0.26.3, bundled for offline diagrams)

Chat replies draw Mermaid diagrams on the phone, with no network, from the bundled mermaid 11.17.2
(`app/src/main/assets/diagram/mermaid.min.js`, the npm package's IIFE build, with its LICENSE beside it).
Mermaid is MIT-licensed by Knut Sveidqvist and contributors.

mermaid.min.js also contains these libraries, each under its own licence:

| Library | Licence |
|---|---|
| dagre-d3-es, cytoscape (+ cose-bilkent, fcose), katex, khroma, marked, roughjs, dayjs, stylis, uuid, langium, lodash-es, ts-dedent, @braintree/sanitize-url, @iconify/utils | MIT |

## sherpa-onnx (My voice, v0.28.0)

`app/src/main/java/com/k2fsa/sherpa/onnx/Tts.kt` is vendored from sherpa-onnx v1.13.8 (Copyright (c) 2023 Xiaomi Corporation), Apache License 2.0, https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx. The native `libsherpa-onnx-jni.so` it talks to is not in the APK; it is downloaded on demand from this repository's `voice-runtime-1.13.8` release, unchanged from the official sherpa-onnx AAR. It statically links ONNX Runtime (MIT, Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation).

The PocketTTS voice model is downloaded from the sherpa-onnx `tts-models` release (`sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26`), an ONNX export (https://github.com/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx-export) of Kyutai's Pocket TTS (https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts). Its LICENSE file is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0; its README notes it is for non-commercial use.

## Apache Commons Compress (v0.28.0)

`org.apache.commons:commons-compress:1.21` (bzip2 reader for the voice model archive), Apache License 2.0, Copyright The Apache Software Foundation.

## AndroidX Media3 (Blaze Music / Video, v0.30.1)

ExoPlayer, MediaSession and PlayerView (`androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer`, `media3-session`, `media3-ui` 1.4.1), Apache License 2.0, Copyright The Android Open Source Project. Source: https://github.com/androidx/media

## Store sources and data (v0.30.1)

No third-party code is bundled for these; Blaze calls their public APIs. Content keeps its own licence, shown on every item.

- **Jamendo** (https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0): Creative Commons music. Needs a client_id from https://devportal.jamendo.com (Jamendo API terms: non-commercial use of the free tier; attribution). No key is shipped.
- **Internet Archive** (https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php, https://archive.org/metadata): only items whose licence url is Creative Commons or public domain (audio), the Feature Films collection (public-domain films) and the Blender open movies.
- **Blender open movies** (Big Buck Bunny, Elephants Dream, Sintel, Tears of Steel, Cosmos Laundromat, Spring, Agent 327, Sprite Fright, Caminandes): © Blender Foundation / Blender Studio, CC BY (Agent 327: CC BY-ND; Spring: public domain mark) as stated on each archive.org item. https://studio.blender.org/films/
- **LRCLIB** (https://lrclib.net): lyrics, looked up on demand, no key.

## YouTube plug-in (v0.30.1, optional module `youtube/`)

Blaze's own code (InnerTube JSON client); no third-party extractor. **NewPipeExtractor was not used:** it is GPL-3.0. Blaze-agent is licensed PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (LICENSE.md), which adds a non-commercial restriction GPL-3.0 forbids, and the APK bundles proprietary Google Play services / ML Kit libraries; a GPL-3.0 dependency would require the whole APK to be GPL-3.0. If the YouTube module moves to a private repo, it still must not pull in GPL code while it ships inside Blaze. Downloading from YouTube may breach YouTube's Terms of Service; the module is isolated so builds can leave it out (delete `youtube/`).
