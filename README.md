# Blaze for Android

AI assistant app for Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose), package `com.blaze.assistant`.
Chat, voice ("Hey Blaze"), floating orb, and phone control through an AccessibilityService.

## Build
1. Install Android Studio (or JDK 17 + Android SDK 34).
2. Open this folder, let Gradle sync.
3. Release APK: `./gradlew assembleRelease` → `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
   Debug APK: `./gradlew assembleDebug`

The release build is signed with `keystore/blaze.keystore` (config in `app/build.gradle.kts`).
**Always use this keystore**, otherwise updates won't install over the existing app.
Keep this repository private because it holds the signing key.
